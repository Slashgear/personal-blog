title: Git TIP -  Why you should not keep a local master branch ?
description: What is a local branch, what is a remote branch ? Why keeping up to date local branch is a waste of time ?

When working with `git`, I have often made the mistake of maintaining a `master` branch locally updated using these commands.

```shell script
git checkout master

git pull origin master
```

I've done this so many times. This allowed me to start a development by being up to date with recent changes.

In fact, it is not necessary to maintain local copies of the branches on which we are not working directly. We already have access to an intact local version of the remote branches.

All this time I could have just done:

```shell script
git checkout origin/master
```

And when you want to work on new stuff, just use


```shell script
git checkout -b my-feature origin/master
```

Keep in mind that this is valid for *master* as well as all other branches on which you do not work directly/on which you will *commit*.
