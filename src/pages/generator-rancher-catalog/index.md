You can add private catalog entry in your Rancher instances, but creating
configuration files could be really hard.

In order to avoid errors, I create a [generator for Rancher catalog entry based on
yeoman.](https://github.com/Slashgear/generator-rancher-catalog)


```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-rancher-catalog
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo rancher-catalog
```

Don't hesitate to contribute, PR are welcome.
