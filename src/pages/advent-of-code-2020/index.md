I decided this year to try the adventofcode2020 challenge in JS to see.
I published the solutions I found in a public repository on Github.
Not sure I will find solution for the upcoming challenges. ðŸ˜…

Take a look at [https://github.com/Slashgear/advent-of-code](https://github.com/Slashgear/advent-of-code)

Project is a _lerna monorepo structure_ showing solution by years and days.

```
packages/
  2019/
    day-1/
      ..
    day-2/
      ..
  2020/
     day-1/
      ..
    day-2/
      ..
    day-3/
      ..
    day-4/
