## AI usage

All articles on this blog are written by hand by me Antoine Caron and not AI.

I am convinced that AI could be a great tool as an assistant for redundant tasks, but I believe in human made content.
I personally use LLM and AI tools to help me write part of my code but this website and articles published are my own.

I made this page to follow [the `AI Manifesto`](https://www.bydamo.la/p/ai-manifesto) from [Damola Morenikeji](https://www.damolamorenikeji.com/) and also inspired from [Cassidy Williams AI page](https://cassidoo.co/ai/).

I will end this small page with this quote:

> Humans had set those machines to usurp our sense of beauty, our necessary selfdom out of which we make living judgments. Naturally, the machines were destroyed.

**Frank Herbert, Dune**
