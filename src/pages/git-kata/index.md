As a part-time computer science teacher, I often give workshops to learn about computers and their tools.
Several times I met teams that had been using Git and Github for many years but were having a lot of trouble.
The basis was known but in practice.

> "Wait, stay still, I'll do that and you can get it back."

> "I'm stuck working on the same file."

> "Pass me your file, I'll add it to my PR."

I'm pretty sure you've heard that before!
It may sound funny but it's quite symptomatic of a lack of practice and reflexes to have when you get to use Git.
Very often users know how to manage but do rather obscure things.

A former colleague preferred to do several `cherry-pick` to retrieve the work of one of his colleagues' successive commits rather than use a `rebase`.

What if I designed a workshop that would allow teams to learn the right reflexes together when using Git and Github?

I had the opportunity to participate in several Coding Dojo/Kata programming sessions and I wanted to be inspired by this model.
Instead of working on code, the workshop I designed focuses on git and its use.

**Here is the link to the workshop, available free of charge on Github.**

It's all in the README.

Leave me your opinions and feedback in comments.
