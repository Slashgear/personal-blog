[Slashgear/webpack-workshop](https://github.com/Slashgear/webpack-workshop)

## How to

Just go to https://webpack-workshop.netlify.app/ and follow the instructions.

If you ❤️ these workshops, don't hesitate to share this post and put a little ⭐️ on the repository.

You could also help me by contributing new workshops, or by translating them into different languages.
